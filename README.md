## A list of CTFs I made for COMP6841 Something Awesome. 
For each CTF, The README.md includes evidence of summary and research, including a list of references. It also analyses the creation of the CTF and the outcomes and its issues under Build Notes and Solution Notes.
It details some of the challenges I came across and how I solved them and includes an explanation of the tools and other materials used to make these ctfs and the materials used to solve them. 
Under Related & Future there are a list of other challenges which would be similar to it in the future to show similar ctfs in the topic area.
Under How Difficulty Was Increased and Defense Mechanisms, I analyse how I made the challenges harder and the defence mechanisms I placed to increse the difficulty of the tasks
